		<h3 class="story">The Story</h3>
		<div>
			<p>
				Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.<br>
				They said, <q class="neighbour">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said,<br>
				<q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,<br>
				<q class="neighbour">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said,<br>
				<q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>
			<p>
				The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,<br>
				<q class="neighbour">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded,<br>
				<q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.<br>
				Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="neighbour">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said,<br>
				<q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.

	<h4>Conclusion</h4>
	<p id="conclusion">
		<span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas.<br>
		Let's not make a big deal out of it...
